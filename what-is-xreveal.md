# Getting Started > What is Xreveal

Xreveal is a Windows based application similar to AnyDVD that removes restrictions of DVD, and Blu-ray media automatically in the background.

Xreveal works in the background to automatically and transparently enable read access of the contents of a movie DVD or Blu-ray as soon as it's inserted into the drive. The DVD/Blu-ray will become useable to your windows operating system and all programs on your computer, such as DVD/Blu-ray backup software like CloneDVD, CloneBD and others, then supporting any DVD or Blu-ray. Xreveal optionally removes region codes, thereby making the movie region free and comfortably viewable on any DVD/Blu-ray player and with any DVD/Blu-ray playback software.
